Two more suggestions to answer questions in a helpful way:  
- If you don't know the answer, don't answer. You're more likely to cause more problems trying to gain metaphorical "brownie points".
- Never insult the asker. They are new and you are not, something that might seem obvious could be the huge first step for a new student.  

Chapter 3 of Free Culture Response:  
Copyright laws and infringement can be a terrifying thing. Jesseâ€™s experience definitely is a horror story, going from creating something as a hobby that he was probably quite proud of into a scapegoat for leeches that used his site for music piracy. 
The RIAA saw a unproductive and easily exploitative individual and used him for profits for their company. While the subject of music copyright is a tricky one, Open source software allows for these types of exploitations to not happpen at all, or at least much more rarely. 
OSS allows up and coming passionate people to explore and experiment their ideas and passions without the fear of the monster that is the American legal system. This allows not only for creativity of the self but also an increased improvement of daily life, as certain software services are improved based on passion and not payment. 
I hope to divuge in projects that connect to passions of mine, so I can work on something I enjoy and will feel proud when reflecting upon my contributions.
