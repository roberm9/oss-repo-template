Using Gitstats vs Github:  
I found gitstats a lot more easier to find data rather than mindlessly clicking around github looking for information.
Interestingly, for Floating Twitch (the repo I picked) I was given a different number of lines of code for the two different ways I looked it up.  
This, however, was probably my user error more then anything, as gitstats gave me 420 lines instead of 300.  
Comparatively, gitstats gives more and places it all in one place, so I guess I'd say I perfer it more. However, that may be due to all the effort I put into getting it installed so I might be biased.
