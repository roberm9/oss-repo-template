##### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?:    
The importance in choosing a license revolves around others knowing what to do with your code.
If it's free software, you want others to be able to know and be comfortable in using your software.
Even in the situation where your code is commericial, you don't want people to copy and redistribute your own software.
People know what they can do with your software and you need to express how you want your software to be used.  


##### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?:
