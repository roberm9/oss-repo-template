##### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?:    
The importance in choosing a license revolves around others knowing what to do with your code.
If it's free software, you want others to be able to know and be comfortable in using your software.
Even in the situation where your code is commericial, you don't want people to copy and redistribute your own software.
People know what they can do with your software and you need to express how you want your software to be used.  


##### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?:    
The unknown is frightening as you could use a project and then get ruined later.
Ignorance doesn't clear you from copyright law and thus if it is not explicitly clear if you can use the software or not, it is just better to not use it.
It's always best to be 100% sure and have 100% concrete proof.


##### Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher. Do you agree with this claim?:    
I do agree with this claim. At its time, inovation and ciritism was plenty and rapid as the internet was slowly putting itself together towards what it looks like today.
Gopher, not going completely open in early development, took the "We know what this "new thing" should be like and no one else does".
Instead of welcoming in the majority of the community to help shape it into something that could benefit everybody (by direct input from the "everybody"), they decided to go along by themselves and try to predict "everybody"'s opnion.
Not very smart, In my personal opinion, and almost never likely to work, and thus I agree with the claim made in this report.
