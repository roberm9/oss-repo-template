###### Step 2:
Q.) Find the Nightly and Experimental sections and look at some of the submissions. How can you see what tests were run for a particular submission?:  

Under Nightly and Experimental sections, you can see each sumission with a couple of stats next to it. You can see under "Test" which tests where not run, failed and passed. To see specifically which tests ran/failed/passed, you can click the number and it brings you do a screen where you can see every test under it's specific category. You can even click a specific test to see certain information corresponding to that test.  
  
Q.) Find a submission with errors. Can you see what the error condition was? How does this help you debug the failure?:  
  
You can click the number under the specific error and it will bring you to a list od said errors. You can then see the specific cmake 'compiling' (or text) that states what went wrong during that specific failure. This specifically tells you what files it couldnt find, or other possible failures, and will allow you to more easily debug the error.  
   
Q.) Find a system that is close to your specific configuration in the Nightly, Nightly Expected or one of the Masters sections. How clean is the dashboard? Are there any errors that you need to be concerned with?:  
  
In the Nightly section, the dashboard is pretty clean. There seems to be little to no errors that are popping up. There are, of course, failed and 'not run' tests, however, each part seems to be free of expected errors in configuration or building.
